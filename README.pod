This is a repository demonstrating a frequent overheating of my CPU with
a program. To run type:

    nice -19 make -j2 results

My CPU is an Intel Core i3 CPU of a computer with these SPECS:

    An Intel Core i3 CPU (x86-64).
    8 GB of RAM.
    Intel Corporation Sandy Bridge Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)
    A 2 TB hard-disk.
    A 21×´ Wide LCD Screen by LG.
    Intel Corporation Cougar Point High Definition Audio Controller.
    Intel Corporation 82579V Gigabit Network Connection.

After you run the command inside tmux, type the "sensors" command to monitor
the CPU temperature.

I'm using Mageia Linux x86-64 5/Cauldron ( L<http://www.mageia.org/> ).
